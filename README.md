## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a full-stack developer with **3 years of active experience**, working across web, systems, and applied AI.  
I enjoy building well-structured, efficient software — from backend logic and system-level components to clean, modern user interfaces.

I primarily work in **Linux environments**, value good tooling, and prefer solutions that are practical, maintainable, and scalable.
